While developing our individual pages we repeatedly ran into conflicts when trying to merge our own branches into the main. Also we were worried about the
coherence between the pages and if the validation will work well together once we merged the Quiz. Luckily we talked about having and working with the 
same layout so it wouldn't interfere. After merging we had to adjust some codeline in the validation and fix some bugs so everything could run smoothly.

We had the most difficulties with commiting / merging / and pulling from and to GitHub were we had to ask our Coaches to help us solve the Problems.
While trying to solve the conflicts there was an better understanding of the proccess and what the problem was.
